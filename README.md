# C++ Exercises - Loops and Number Operations

This repository contains a set of C++ exercises that demonstrate the use of loops (`while` and `for`) to perform common number-based operations. Each program is written in a separate file named `exercise1.cpp`, `exercise2.cpp`, etc.

## Table of Contents

- [Exercise 2 - Multiplication Table](#exercise-2---multiplication-table)
- [Exercise 3 - Prime Number Check](#exercise-3---prime-number-check)

## Exercise 1 - Sum of First N Integers

Write a C++ program that reads an integer `n` and uses a `while` loop to calculate the sum of the first `n` integers.

---

## Exercise 2 - Multiplication Table

Write a C++ program that reads an integer `x` and uses a `for` loop to print the multiplication table of `x` (from x Ã— 1 to x Ã— 10).

---

## Exercise 3 - Prime Number Check

Write a C++ program that reads an integer `n` and uses a `while` loop to determine whether it is a prime number. The program should output `"Primo"` if it is a prime number, and `"NÃ£o Ã© primo"` otherwise.

---

## Exercise 4 - Fibonacci Sequence

Write a C++ program that reads an integer `n` and uses a `for` loop to print the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.  
Example output: `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...`

---

## Exercise 5 - Largest of 10 Numbers

Write a C++ program that reads 10 integers from the user. Use a `for` loop to determine and print the largest number among the input values.

---

## Purpose

These exercises were developed as part of my academic learning in C++ programming. They help reinforce concepts related to loops, conditionals, and basic number processing logic.

## Technologies Used

- Language: C++
- IDE: [Visual Studio Code]
- Compiler: g++ / MinGW
